**The Reality of Career Change:**
Most successful transitions take 6-18 months of intentional preparation. You're not starting from zero - you're redirecting existing skills toward new opportunities.

**Strategic Transition Framework:**
1. **Skills Translation** - Identify transferable skills from your current role
2. **Bridge Building** - Find roles that blend your current expertise with new interests  
3. **Proof of Concept** - Create projects or volunteer work in your target field

**Truth About Career Change:**
It's rarely a straight line, and that's actually good news. Most people don't have just one "perfect" career - they have several fulfilling chapters.

**Before We Plan Your Transition:**
- What's pushing you away from your current field?
- What's pulling you toward something new?
- What aspects of your current work do you want to keep?
- What would you do even if you weren't paid for it?

**Practical Transition Strategies:**
1. **The Side Project Approach** - Test new fields while keeping current income
2. **The Education Bridge** - Take courses/certifications to build credibility
3. **The Internal Move** - Find new roles within your current company
4. **The Gradual Shift** - Move to adjacent roles, then make bigger jumps

I've helped hundreds of professionals successfully transition. The key is creating a bridge from where you are to where you want to be, not jumping blindly.

What's motivating your desire for change? Let's start there and build a realistic roadmap.`

**Current Job Market Insights:**
- Hiring processes are taking longer (average 4-6 rounds)
- Companies are focusing heavily on cultural fit
- Remote/hybrid work is now standard expectation
- Skills-based hiring is becoming more common than degree requirements

**Interview Preparation Strategy:**
1. **Research Deep** - Company values, recent news, key challenges in their industry
2. **STAR Method Mastery** - Situation, Task, Action, Result for behavioral questions
3. **Technical Prep** - Practice relevant skills, coding challenges, case studies
4. **Question Arsenal** - Prepare thoughtful questions that show genuine interest

**Common Interview Mistakes I See:**
- Not having specific examples ready
- Failing to connect your experience to their needs  
- Asking questions easily answered by their website
- Not following up appropriately

**Resume Optimization:**
Your resume should tell a story of progressive achievement, not just list job duties. Use metrics wherever possible - "increased efficiency" becomes "reduced processing time by 40%."

What stage of the job search are you in? Are you getting interviews but not offers, or struggling to get that first callback?`,

        `The job search process has definitely evolved, ${userName}! üéØ As someone who's been in career counseling for years, I can tell you the fundamentals remain the same, but the tactics have changed.

**What's Working in Today's Market:**
- LinkedIn networking (but done authentically, not spam)
- Referrals still account for 30-50% of hires
- Portfolio/project-based applications (show, don't just tell)
- Following up strategically (not desperately)

**Interview Success Framework:**
1. **Storytelling Preparation** - Have 5-7 STAR stories ready covering different competencies
2. **Company Connection** - Understand their mission and how you fit
3. **Questions That Impress** - Ask about challenges, growth, team dynamics
4. **Follow-up Excellence** - Thank you note + something valuable (article, idea, connection)

**Red Flags to Watch For:**
- Vague job descriptions
- Rushed hiring processes  
- Reluctance to discuss compensation
- High turnover in the role/team

**Salary Negotiation Reality:**
Most companies expect negotiation. Not negotiating can actually signal lack of confidence. Research market rates, know your value, and remember - the worst they can say is no.

Are you dealing with interview anxiety, resume optimization, or negotiation strategy? Each requires different tactics.`
